## Generate a new React project with Typescript support built in
# terminal cmd: npx create-react-app <appname> --template typescript
## If your file will contain a React component or any kind of the JSX, then we use the extension '.tsx'
## If file does not contain JSX, use '.ts' 
## Passing down props from Parent to Child
### We will be utilizing Inferaces to define what props Child expects to receive 
#### Interfaces will check 1) Are we providing the correct props to Child when we show it in Parent? 2) Are we using teh correctly names + typed props in Child?
## All React Components can optionally provide these properties: 1) propTyes 2) displayName 3) defaultProps 4) contextTypes 
### *Do note Typescript doesn't know that we are making a React Component, so it thinks that 'Child' will not have these properties!
#####
## export const Child: React.FC<ChildProps> = ({color}) => {}
### above is syntax for a specific React Function Component
### Which means there may be additional componenents assigned to it.
### 'Child' might have properties assigned to it like 'propTypes' and 'contextTypes'
### 'Child' will receive props of type 'ChildProps' 
### const [guests, setGuests] = useState<string[]>([]);
#### here we set guests as type of array of strings in teh useState hook <string[]>
### const [name, setName] = useState('');
#### here when making use of state inside of React we set the default value of empty strings, if TS can figure out what type that value is all is good, if not then we define the type inside angle brackets
